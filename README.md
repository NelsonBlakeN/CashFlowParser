# CashFlowParser

I'm someone who carefully budgets their income, and separates it into different categories for spending. All of this documentation is recorded in the incredibly complex recording software Microsoft Excel. It would be useful to have a tool that would read these expenses and categorize them into highest grossing and most frequent purchases, and notify me once a week with a recap. So that's what this project is for.
